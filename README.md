<h1>Foundation Exam Bot</h1>

This project is a bot that I have created for my Foundation Exam/Math practice discord. Currently I'm working to implement all the features listed on the to-do list under here as soon as possible.
This bot will be entirely coded in python.

<b>To-do List</b>
<ul>
  <li>Welcome message</li>
  <li>Custom commands</li>
  <li>Add roles</li>
 </ul>
